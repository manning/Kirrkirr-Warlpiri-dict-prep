	SOX - SOund eXchange

SOX translates sound samples between various file formats.
It also does a few simple sound effects.  SOX knows most
of the standard PC, Mac, and workstation formats and
can handle most anything you find on the Internet
or a BBS.  It doesn't handle MIDI, MOD, or other music
format files because they are not sound samples.

This is the DOS binary distribution of SOX version 10.
SOX is primarily a Unix utility.  Its command line
options are a) unix-y and b) a massive pain.
