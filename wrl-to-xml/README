README for Kirrkirr/Warlpiri dictionary visualizer project XML file creation
----------------------------------------------------------------------------


DICTIONARY DATA
---------------

At present the dictionary is ultimately based on the 980311 version of
the Warlpiri dictionary.  It resides in the one and two letter long
filenames in: 

	/project/kirrkirr/data/Wrlpdic-980311

The most recent original documentation of the codes in the dictionary
are in:

	/project/kirrkirr/data/wrlpdict.970805/WrlpDict.970410/Z Code Files/WarlpiriDictDatabaseCodes.9612


XML DICTIONARY
--------------

The Perl program to create the XML dictionary is:

	/project/kirrkirr/src/wrl-to-xml/wrl-xml-new.pl

It is usually run by scripts.  The input and output to this program are in:

	/project/kirrkirr/data/wrl-proc

The input is the file:

	Wrl

It is just a concatenation of all the dictionary files from the
directory mentioned above:

	cat /project/kirrkirr/data/Wrlpdic-980311/? /project/kirrkirr/data/Wrlpdic-980311/?? >Wrl

In that directory one can rebuild the Warlpiri dict XML file with:

	./newconv.sh

This creates the files:

	newWrl.xml	The complete dictionary
	newWrl.err	A record of all errors and warnings encountered.

One can check that the XML file is well-formed with the following command:

	./verifynew.csh

Note that the dict->xml converter can be run in two modes.  The
"Kevin" mode where subentries are promoted to entries with a "SUB"
value for the TYPE attribute, and the original mode where subentries
are nested inside an entry.  The current version of Kirrkirr uses the
"Kevin" mode, and this is the current default for the conversion.

Many of the other files in the directory are just historical.
newconvtest.sh, newtest.data, newtest.xml, newtest.err provide a small
subset of the dictionary to test changes on.  (Cf. newtest-ok.xml
newtest-ok.err).  censWrl.xml was made as a "censored" version
omitting certain entries (sex, swearing).
