They fly high in the sky, then they land on the ground, like many other birds too. At night they all perch together in a flock in a tree. Like in a big leafy tree they all sit at night sleeping.

The heron, it has long thin legs like the bustard and the curlew. Although the curlew is smaller than those other two -- than the bustard and the heron. Although the heron is really big, there are other herons that are smallish and which are actually black. The big heron is tall and thin.

When the red-winged cockatoo has young ones, I don't know about it -- perhaps it sits in a nest I don't really know. I actually don't know; I haven't seen one. I only ever actually see the adults (not the chicks).

They fly away, they fly through the air like these others, it is all the birds that fly through the air. We call all those creatures that fly though the air birds. Like the egret which flies in the sky as well. And which later lands as another waterhole.
